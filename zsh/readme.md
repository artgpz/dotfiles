How to use:

1.- run the script

```
cd ~/bin/zsh_config.sh
chmod +x zsh_config.sh # if needed
./zsh_config.sh
```

2.- change to user eg. deploy

```
sudo -su deploy
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

> [!NOTE]
> in azure you must first assign a password to the user before being able to change the default shell
